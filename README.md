This repository contains the code to download data for Climate Neutral and Smart Cities, the 9th of EOSC Future Task 6.3â€™s Science Project.

## Setup:

- Python must be installed. The code has been tested with Python 3.9.
- Python requirements are listed in the file requirements.txt. They can be installed using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- To download ERA5 data from the Copernicus Climate Data Store, an API key is needed. It can be obtained by following instructions here: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api-how-to.
